United States of America,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics.

United States of America,"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple.

Italy,"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish.

United States of America,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach.

South Africa,"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",90,25,Stellenbosch,Lauren Buzzeo,Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),Chardonnay,Oldenburg,2013
South Africa,"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah.

United States of America,"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gew√ºrtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge.

Argentina,"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",85,10,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda (Mendoza),Bonarda,Andean Sky,2007
United States of America,"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",85,28,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Silvan Ridge,2006

France,"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so.

Spain,"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish.

Argentina,"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice.

Argentina,"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy.

South Africa,"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",89,18,Coastal Region,Lauren Buzzeo,Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region),Red Blend,Graham Beck,2007

United States of America,"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari.

Argentina,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas.

South Africa,"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat.

Australia,"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",92,70,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Shiraz,Kilikanoon,2009

Chile,"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content.

Portugal,"A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors.

Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites.

United States of America,"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet.

United States of America,"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish.

United States of America,"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch.

United States of America,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.",93,45,California,Virginie Boone,Limerick Lane 2013 Headpruned Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),Syrah,Limerick Lane,2013

United States of America,"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once.",93,100,California,Matt Kettmann,Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast),Red Blend,Turiya,2011
United States of America,"Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar.

France,"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness.

At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine.

United States of America,"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.",87,20,California,Jim Gordon,Terre Rouge 2013 Vin Doux Naturel Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains,Terre Rouge,2013
Argentina,"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.",87,175,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Antonio Mas 2011 Roll Fermentor Malbec (Tupungato),Malbec,Antonio Mas,2011
Italy,"Cellar floor, eucalyptus, black spice and a note recalling grilled celery lead the nose.

Argentina,"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.",87,15,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Bodega Calle 2014 Alberti 154 Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Bodega Calle,2014

United States of America,"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood‚Äî31% new and 26% once-used‚Äîseems to show a bit of rawness.

It finishes simply and without fuss.",87,34,California,Virginie Boone,Ektimo Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Ektimo Vineyards,2014
Spain,"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete.

New Zealand,"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased.

Drink now.",85,9,Marlborough,Joe Czerwinski,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Kono,2008

Chile,"Good introductory Carmen√®re. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through.

Argentina,"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance.

United States of America,"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part.

United States of America,"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart‚Äîred fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",88,75,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Pinot Noir,The Four Graces,2005

Argentina,"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold.

Israel,"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus.

United States of America,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting.

United States of America,"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.",88,22,California,Matt Kettmann,Ventana 2013 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),Chardonnay,Ventana,2013

Italy,"This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins.

Sullivan,WildAire 2012 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Syrah,WildAire,2012

New Zealand,"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",87,70,Hawke's Bay,Joe Czerwinski,Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Babich,2011
Spain,"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.",85,15,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Rentas de Fincas 2003 Crianza  (Rioja),Red Blend,Rentas de Fincas,2003

United States of America,"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",85,24,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Honeywood Winery,2006
Spain,"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albari√±o and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia.

Austria,"One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Gr√ºner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example.

Chile,"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors.

France,"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing.",85,11,Southwest France,Roger Voss,Ch√¢teau B√©lingard 2005  Monbazillac,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Ch√¢teau B√©lingard,2005

United States of America,"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.",90,10,California,Jim Gordon,Cookies & Cream 2010 Merlot (California),Merlot,Cookies & Cream,2010
United States of America,"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life.

United States of America,"This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto C√£o (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souz√£o. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit.

United States of America,"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new.

France,"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste.

Australia,"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent.

Austria,"Manfred Felsner obviously enjoys the spicy character of Gr√ºner Veltliner, because, like all his wines from this varietal, this has spice in spades.

Argentina,"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla.

Chile,"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua.

Hungary,"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews.

Argentina,"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality.

Spain,"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",85,10,Central Spain,Michael Schachner,Tape√±a 2006 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Verdejo,Tape√±a,2006
Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors.

Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",85,10,Galicia,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro),White Blend,Bodegas Campante,2006
Australia,"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",85,30,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,Brick Road 2005 Nine Gums Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Shiraz,Brick Road,2005

Spain,"For classic Rioja, Monte Real is always a good bet. This offering delivers textbook aromas of dried raspberry and cherry offset by fallen leaves and a pinch of seashell. The palate is still quite fresh, while black cherry, raisin, spice and cocoa flavors finish smooth and long, with a touch of oxidation and a Sherry note for added complexity.

United States of America,"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry.

United States of America,"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees.

Italy,"Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose.

United States of America,"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin.

France,"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure.

Spain,"Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane.

Australia,"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll.

United States of America,"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley.

United States of America,"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth.

Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.",90,36,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Whitman Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,Whitman Cellars,2005
France,"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins. There is a stalky element of black currant skins which adds to the sensation of dryness, but there is also a more mouthfilling character of black plum juice to give the wine a final roundness.",90,31,Bordeaux,Roger Voss,Vieux Ch√¢teau Gaubert 2005  Graves,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vieux Ch√¢teau Gaubert,2005

Chile,"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmen√®re, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors.

United States of America,There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts.

Argentina,"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex.

Argentina,"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors.

Spain,"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat.

United States of America,"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion.

Germany,"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar.

Germany,"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality.

Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",90,36,Pfalz,Joe Czerwinski,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Sp√§tlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),Riesling,Georg Mosbacher,2007
South Africa,"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red. On the palate, cedar, mocha and pepper give it a rich, brooding quality. Tannins are fine but ageable.

United States of America,"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State.

Spain,"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it.

Germany,"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality.

Australia,"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5‚Äì6 years.

Chile,"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit.

Chile,"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth.

Chile,"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone.

United States of America,"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper.

Chile,"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh.

Chile,"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo.

Sullivan,Ryan Patrick 2013 Reserve Northridge Vineyard Grenache (Wahluke Slope),Grenache,Ryan Patrick,2013

France,"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness.

Italy,"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit.

Chile,"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",84,10,Curic√≥ Valley,Michael Schachner,Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curic√≥ Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Carmen,2009
Argentina,"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors.

France,"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity.

Slightly tropical and simple.",84,11,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Luigi Bosca 2009 Finca la Linda Chardonnay (Luj√°n de Cuyo),Chardonnay,Luigi Bosca,2009
Argentina,"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor.

United States of America,"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles.

United States of America,"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",83,26,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Estate Malbec (Wahluke Slope),Malbec,Gilbert Cellars,2007
Australia,"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors.

United States of America,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",86,30,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Anam Cara 2005 Nicholas Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Anam Cara,2005
United States of America,"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",86,37,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuv√©e Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Pinot Noir,Archery Summit,2004

Australia,"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit.

Australia,"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.",86,37,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,Pearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Pearson Vineyards,2005

Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",86,25,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Campos G√≥ticos 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Tempranillo,Campos G√≥ticos,2003
Spain,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out.

Argentina,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus.

United States of America,"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic.

Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‚Äò03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",85,29,Central Spain,Michael Schachner,Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vitis Terrarum,2003

A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend).

Chile,"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings.

United States of America,"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice.

Italy,"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors.

United States of America,"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit.

Argentina,"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines.

United States of America,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",92,40,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Soos Creek 2005 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),Red Blend,Soos Creek,2005
United States of America,"The blend is classic Bordeaux‚Äî85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry.

The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016.",92,60,Maipo Valley,Michael Schachner,Domus Aurea 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Domus Aurea,2008

United States of America,"A field blend ice wine‚Äîdon't see that very often‚Äîit's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits‚Äîtropical, stone fruits and citrus.

Germany,"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",91,84,Mosel,Joe Czerwinski,Dr. H.

United States of America,"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style‚Äîgrapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",91,28,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon),Rh√¥ne-style White Blend,Francis Tannahill,2008
United States of America,"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and ‚ÄúSuitcase clone La Tache‚Äù on its tech sheet.

Spain,"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous.

Spain,"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending.

Very pleasing picnic wine.",86,10,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),Cabernet Sauvignon,Avery Lane,2007

Spain,"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green.

Portugal,Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well.

United States of America,"Pomegranate, dark plum and slate show on the simple nose of this appellation blend. The palate is light, with hints of strawberry and plum as well as pencil lead and mace.

Argentina,"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic.

Spain,"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",87,17,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Nisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),Verdejo,Nisia,2014
United States of America,"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.",87,47,California,Matt Kettmann,Passaggio 2014 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Pinot Noir,Passaggio,2014
United States of America,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip.",87,25,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Plaisance Ranch 2013 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley),Red Blend,Plaisance Ranch,2013
Portugal,"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar.

United States of America,"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose.

Argentina,"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff.",83,25,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Caligiore 2008 Organic Legacy Old Vines Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Caligiore,2008

Spain,"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet.

Chile,"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied.

Chile,"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.",90,24,Cachapoal Valley,Michael Schachner,Lapostolle 2007 Cuv√©e Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),Syrah,Lapostolle,2007
United States of America,"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Gr√ºner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",90,18,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),White Blend,Syncline,2009
Argentina,"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic.

South Africa,"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish.

Austria,"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Gr√ºner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character.

United States of America,"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled.

This is a lovely sipper.",91,19,California,Virginie Boone,Starmont 2015 Ros√© of Pinot Noir (Carneros),Pinot Noir,Starmont,2015
United States of America,"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a ros√©. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",91,24,California,Matt Kettmann,Stephen Ross 2015 Ros√© of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross,2015

France,"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front.

United States of America,"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down.

Argentina,"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate.

United States of America,"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris.

Portugal,"Straw yellow in color, this now mature wine is made from 100-year old vines, planted in sandy soils above the Tejo (Tagus) river. It has richness, touches of toast and yeast and smooth flavors of vanilla and spice.

United States of America,"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill.",91,40,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Quady North 2010 Vinum Pro Virtus Arsenal Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Applegate Valley),Cabernet Franc-Merlot,Quady North,2010

Sullivan,Rudius 2013 Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Syrah,Rudius,2013
United States of America,"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.",91,48,California,Jim Gordon,Saxon Brown 2012 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,Saxon Brown,2012
Italy,"Vibrant and elegant, this refreshing, mineral-driven white offers aromas of white spring flower, ripe orchard fruit and citrus blossom. Bright acidity frames the juicy pear, apple and flint flavors, while the crisp finish closes on a saline note. This is a fantastic wine from a grape grown only at the Sella & Mosca estate in Sardinia.",91,20,Sicily & Sardinia,Kerin O‚ÄôKeefe,Sella & Mosca 2014 Terre Bianche Torbato (Alghero),Torbato,Sella & Mosca,2014
United States of America,"Albari√±o is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.",91,25,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Treos 2014 Albari√±o (Willamette Valley),Albari√±o,Treos,2014

Spain,"A big, burly wine that's loaded with power and fruit but is also tannic and drying. Tastes sort of raisiny and hot, with grating tannic scrub and fire in the hole. Pretty good but it doesn't have the purity, elegance and clean richness of the region's best wines.",86,49,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Matsu 2008  Toro,Tinta de Toro,Matsu,2008
Argentina,"A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors. With more airing it grows rounder and more complex, but overall it's exacting, odd and funky.",86,20,Other,Michael Schachner,Michel Torino 2009 Don David Finca La Maravilla #6 Malbec (Cafayate),Malbec,Michel Torino,2009
United States of America,"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins.

United States of America,"This late-harvest Viognier looks like a still wine as it comes out of the bottle, exploding with honey and wildflowers on the nose.

United States of America,"Light strawberry fruit is matched to barrel notes of cola and caramel. There is more than a trace of barnyard and earth, and the tannins have a tea-like astringency.

United States of America,"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough‚Äîand very fairly priced‚Äîto pop open with a midweek steak.

United States of America,"A cooler vintage in the Columbia Valley, which perhaps contributes to a wine that seems rather hard and thin. Though the alcohol is listed at 14.2%, the fruit is tight and one dimensional, with dominant acidity.

New Zealand,"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style.
